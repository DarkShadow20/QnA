# CLI QUIZ About Myself

This was my first JavaScript miniproject.
CHALK is used to make it more appealing.
So basically this consists of some questions about me and for each right answer player gets 5 points while on wrong answer player gets negative marks.
The questions are basically in an array of objects which are parsed and send to function as arguements.

So play and enjoy this quiz.
